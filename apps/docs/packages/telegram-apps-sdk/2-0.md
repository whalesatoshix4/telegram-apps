# @telegram-apps/sdk@2.0

Before diving deep into the documentation of this package, it is recommended to familiarize
yourself with the following packages:

- [@telegram-apps/signals](../telegram-apps-signals.md) - our own JavaScript signals used almost
  everywhere in the package.
- [@telegram-apps/bridge](../telegram-apps-bridge.md) - the lowest level communication layer with
  Telegram Mini Apps. The SDK uses it under the hood and re-exports some functionality.
